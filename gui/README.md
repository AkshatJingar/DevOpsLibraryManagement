## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure your Node.js backend server is running on port 5000
2. The backend should have CORS enabled (or you may need to add it)

### Running the GUI

1. **Start your backend server first:**
   ```bash
   cd book-management
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open the GUI:**
   - Navigate to the `gui` folder
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve it using a local server:
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
     npx http-server -p 8000
     ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - If opened directly: `file:///path/to/book-management/gui/index.html`
   - If served: `http://localhost:8000`

## API Endpoints Used

The GUI connects to your backend API at `http://localhost:5000/api`:

- `GET /api/books` - Get all books
- `GET /api/books/:id` - Get specific book
- `POST /api/books` - Add new book
- `PUT /api/books/:id` - Update book
- `DELETE /api/books/:id` - Delete book

### Searching and Filtering

2. **Filter**: Use the dropdown to show only available or unavailable books
3. **Clear**: Click "Clear Filters" to reset all search and filter options

### Editing a Book

## File Structure

```
gui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles and responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Customization

### Changing the API URL
If your backend runs on a different port or URL, edit the `API_BASE_URL` constant in `script.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
```

### Styling
The CSS file (`styles.css`) is well-organized and commented. You can easily customize:
- Colors and gradients
- Fonts and typography
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions

### Adding Features
The JavaScript file (`script.js`) is modular and well-structured. You can easily add:
- Additional search filters
- Sorting options
- Export functionality
- Bulk operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Books not loading:**
   - Check if your backend server is running on port 5000
   - Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for errors
   - Verify the API endpoints are working by testing them directly

2. **CORS errors:**
   - Add CORS middleware to your backend server:
     ```javascript
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors());
     ```

3. **GUI not responsive:**
   - Make sure you're using a modern browser
   - Check if all CSS and JavaScript files are loading properly
